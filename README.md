# Mobile-Monitoring-and-Control-Application-for-a-Coffee-Bean-Dryer-Based-on-the-Internet-of-Things-
Background. Indonesia, as one of the world's largest coffee producers, faces challenges in improving coffee productivity compared to other leading coffee-producing countries. The traditional coffee bean drying process, which often relies on weather conditions, results in inconsistent quality. Aim. This research aims to design and develop a mobile monitoring and control application based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for a rotary coffee bean drying machine. The machine integrates a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, and is controlled by a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller with actuators such as an electric motor, heater, and fan. The developed mobile application enables real-time monitoring and control of the drying process via Android devices, providing an efficient solution to weather-related challenges. Method. The research employed the waterfall method. Results. Testing showed that the system could maintain temperature within an optimal range and significantly reduce the moisture content of coffee beans, decreasing it from 22% to 12.4% within 2 hours. Conclusion. This system not only makes the drying process more consistent but also more controlled, offering significant potential benefits for the coffee industry.
